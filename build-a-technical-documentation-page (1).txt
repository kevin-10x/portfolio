            <p>Mobile app development is the act or process by which a mobile app is developed for one or more mobile devices...</p>
            <p>Mobile app development has been steadily growing in terms of revenues and jobs created...</p>
            <p>In order to facilitate the development of applications for mobile devices...</p>
            <p>Today, mobile apps are usually distributed via an official online outlet or marketplace (e.g. Apple - The App Store, Google - Google Play) and there is a formalized process by which developers submit their apps for approval and inclusion in those marketplaces. Historically, however, that was not always the case.</p>

<p>Mobile UIs, or front-ends, rely on mobile back-ends to support access to enterprise systems. The mobile back-end facilitates data routing, security, authentication, authorization, working off-line, and service orchestration. This functionality is supported by a mix of middleware components, including mobile app servers, mobile backend as a service (MBaaS), and service-oriented architecture (SOA) infrastructure</p>

            </ul>
              <p>The software development packages needed to develop, deploy, and manage mobile apps are made from many components and tools which allow a developer to write, test, and deploy applications for one or more target platforms.</p>
              <p>First party tools include official SDKs published by, or on behalf of, the company responsible for the design of a particular hardware platform (e.g. Apple, Google, etc) as well as any third-party software that is officially supported for the purpose of developing mobile apps for that hardware.</p>

            <p>Google Android Emulator - an Android emulator that is patched to run on a Windows PC...</p>
            <p>iPhoney - gives a pixel-accurate web browsing environment and it is powered by Safari. It can be used while developing web sites for the iPhone. It is not an iPhone simulator but instead is designed for web developers who want to create 320 by 480 (or 480 by 320) websites for use with iPhones. iPhoney will only run on OS X 10.4.7 or later.</p>
            <p>BlackBerry Simulator - There are a variety of official BlackBerry simulators available to emulate the functionality of actual BlackBerry products and test how the device software, screen, keyboard and trackwheel will work with the application.</p>
<p>Windows UI Automation - To test applications that use the Microsoft UI Automation technology, it requires Windows Automation API 3.0. It is pre-installed on Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and later versions of Windows. On other operating systems, you can install it using Windows Update or download it from the Microsoft Web site.</p>
